So I decided to look around at gyms, I miss the free membership and working out on a daily basis but its hard to get in to unless youre already there for me... s yea, front desk jobs or maybe even some lifeguarding just cause I still have the certs and theyre short shifts so it would be easy to fit in and still not take up a lot of time... so yea, sadly thats the mission for the next week or two, find a job at a gym.
