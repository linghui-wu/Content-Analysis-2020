The chick next to me was yelling to her boyfriend all about her day, her mom, her friends pregnancy, and was even showing him cell phone picks, rather than enjoying the music (or at least keeping her voice down so I didn't have to hear all about how her friends due date was in a week and how she was going to just go down and be induced tomorrow because she was so big).
