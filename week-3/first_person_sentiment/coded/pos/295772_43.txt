Anyways, we had to wait for quite a long time before we were briefed and got into our jumpsuit and masks and whatever equipments we needed... hah we looked like a bunch of snipers =P anyways... the first time around, we got excited and a bunch of us opted to go up to the second level of the "building" and hid there...
