I managed to scare off a guy whom I didn't even know whether he was an enemy or a teammate... seriously, everybody looks the same when they're in there, whether they have an armband or not, especially looking through the foggy mask... and for the rest of it, I just shot randomly at empty spaces... you can't even see whether it hit anybody or not anyways -_-
